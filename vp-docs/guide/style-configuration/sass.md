# Sass

Vue-Good-Table's styling is written in Sass. The source files are made available as part of the npm dependency.

**Vue-Good-Table's root Sass file:**

```scss
@import "../node_modules/vue-good-table/src/styles/style.scss";
```

Vue-Good-Table has an optional feature to filter a column based on a multi-select dropdown. We use Vue-Select for this feature.

**Vue-Select's root Sass file**

```scss
@import "../node_modules/vue-select/src/scss/vue-select.scss";
```
